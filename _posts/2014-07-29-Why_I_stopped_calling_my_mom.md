I became a bit depressed after deciding to stay in the US for the fall semester and stopped calling my mom. I used to call her every week to check in with her. Most of the time it goes like:

Me: Hi Mom.

Mom: How are you doing? How's school? Busy?

Me: I'm doing OK. Same old same old. (I'm not very good at telling people my problems and I have not been telling my mom about them since senior high.) How about you?

Mom: It is really hot/cold/rainy here. I got a cold/headache/stomache again. I did not get enough sleep last night. 

Me: You need to take better care of yourself. Are you having your meals on time?

Mom: Not really. I have so many things to do in the morning and customers keep coming in when we are having lunch or dinner (my mom runs a litter restauraunt next to a university with a million other restaurants). The customers stay around too late in the evening. The staff I hired are lazy and clumsy. 

Me: Why don't you turn them down while you're eating or after 10PM if that bothers you. Just tell them you are closed.

Mom: No I cannot. If I turn them down, they will go to the neighbour's. 

Me: Then I do not know how you can solve that problem. 

Mom: The neighbour had more customers than I do yesterday. 

Me: But sometimes it is the opposite.

Mom: That is true. But I'm just angry when it is not.

Me: ......

Mom: The girls in universities dress up really nicely; they are nothing like you. Why your boyfriend earns so little with his PhD? So-and-so is earning so-and-so without any degree. Why you're still in school? So-and-so got married and so-and-so already have kids. So and so, so and so, so and so...

Me: Shall I break up with my boyfriend then? 

Mom: If you can find someone better.

Me: I'm afraid I cannot.

Mom: Well, you take care. I do not understand why you choose to study abroad. Such harsh life. I'm so worried about you. Be happy. Don't worry about money.

Me interupting: Mom I'm not worried about money.

Mom: OK if you say so. I need to take the checks now (already start talking to her customers). Call me more often. 

Me: OK I will.

She got really upset when I stopped calling her. I did not stop contacting her. I sent voice messages and pictures to her now and then. I just could not handle more depressing conversations like that; and the thought of becoming someonelike her scared me a lot. In general she is a very good person. Hard working and considerate. She is very friendly and a lot of fun to her customers but I just don't get to have that part.

She ended up calling my boyfriend a lot. My boyfriend also started to call her more often when he learnt that I stopped calling her. He is as poor as I am but he has no problem with it. He has this brilliant spirit about life and everything that nothing really matters to him. He told me he is happy to do this for me. I wonder why he's not affected by those talkings. Is it because he is not her son so the conversations will be slightly different (more towards the customer style?)? Or because the way he is? I do not know. I do not know how to settle this. After all, running away from your mom is a race you'll never win:) Calling her tonight.
